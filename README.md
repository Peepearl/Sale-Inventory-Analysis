# Sale-Inventory-Forecast Analysis

Project Type: Business Case Analysis
Tools Used: Power Query, Power Pivot, Power BI

Project Overview
This project was carried out as part of my second-week task during my data analysis internship at Awake Power Communication.

The primary goal was to analyze inventory and forecast data to answer key business questions related to product availability and stockout risks. The outcome was a data-driven recommendation to help the organization avoid lost sales and plan proactively.

Business Questions
The analysis was driven by the following key questions:
- Which products are at risk of stockout in the next 4 weeks?
- Does the current inventory cover the predicted demand?
- What impact would a demand surge (e.g., seasonal or marketing-driven) have on inventory?
- Which product categories are most vulnerable to stockouts?

Tools & Techniques Used:
- Data Cleaning using Power Query
- Data Modeling in Power Pivot
Actions Taken
- Creation of a Calendar Table
- DAX Measures for forecasting and analysis
- Interactive Slicers and filters for dashboard flexibility
- Business Intelligence techniques to simulate scenarios

Key Insight
Based on the current inventory and projected demand, the company will likely face stockouts within the next 4 weeks, leading to potential financial loss.

Actionable Recommendation: Immediate restocking is required to meet forecasted demand and maintain revenue stability.

Dataset Description
The Excel file used contains the following sheets:
- Sales: Sales records
- Inventory: Current stock levels
- Forecast: Demand projections
- ProductMaster: Product metadata
- Business Questions: Analytical objectives and scenarios

Reflection
This project gave me real-world exposure to solving practical business problems with data. It also strengthened my skills in data transformation, forecasting, and dashboard creation using Power BI tools.
I also contributed to communication within the internship cohort, sharing insights and supporting group coordination.
